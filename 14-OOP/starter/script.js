// I learnt the introduction to Object Oriented Programming

// Principles of OOP
// 1. Abstraction: ignoring or hiding details that doesnt matter
// 2. Encapsulation: keeping methods and properties private inside d class so that they are not accesible from outside the class
// 3. Inheritance: making all properties and methods of a class (parent class) available to another class (child class)
// 4. Polymorphism: A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from its parent class

// OOP in JS: Prototypes
// All objects in JS are linked to a certain prototype object
// Prototypal Inheritance: All objects that are linked to a certain prototype object can use the method & properties that are defined on that prototype
